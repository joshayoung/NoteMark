### Notes
* You have to add `INTERNET` permissions in order to make API calls.
* You can use 'Image Asset Studio' inside of Android Studio to create all of the app icons you need.
  * I just used my splash image as a starting point. 
    * See notes on creating the splash image [here](https://github.com/joshayoung/android-kotlin-app-training/blob/main/README.md)
